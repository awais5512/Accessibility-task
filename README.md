### Accessibility Task Project Landing Page

#### This project is a small landing page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing the use of ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) and other accessibility features to improve the user experience for people with disabilities.

#### Features:

Semantic HTML: The page uses semantic HTML elements to improve screen reader compatibility and overall structure.

ARIA attributes: ARIA attributes are used to help assistive technologies navigate the page more easily.

Keyboard Navigation: All interactive elements are focusable and can be navigated using the keyboard, ensuring users who cannot use a mouse can still access all content.

Contrast and Color Accessibility: The color scheme and contrast ratios are chosen to ensure readability for users with visual impairments.

Accessible Forms: Forms include appropriate labels and are designed to be navigable and usable with screen readers.

Focus Styles: Clear focus styles are provided for interactive elements, making it easier for keyboard users to see where they are on the page.
